This is a script I wrote for an organization to reduce hours spent on
repetative tasks. Typically, the administrative assistant receives
a large pdf (~80 pages) each month. She has to manualy sift through each page in
the pdf and find all pages that have the same account number, and then save alll
the pages with like account numbers to a single pdf named after the account
number. In the end, she might have 20 individual pdfs of ~2-3 pages in length 
each named after the account number. This automates the process.
