This is a script I wrote for a friend. His administrative assistant receives
a large (~80 pages) pdf each month. She has to manualy go through each page,
find all pages that have the same account number and save all the pages with
like account numbers to one pdf. In the end, she might have 20 individual pdfs,
each named after the account number and each pdf may have numerous pages
(because account numbers may occur more than once). This automates the process.
